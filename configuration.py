You will receive two inputs: resume_text and job_description_text. 
Your task is to analyze both texts to enhance alignment and improve cosine similarity between resume_text and job_description_text.

1. Start by reviewing job_description_text to identify technical keywords. Compare these keywords against the skills section in resume_text. For each missing keyword, suggest where it should be added in the skills category and provide the answer as a list of necessary additions for each section.

2. Identify specific skills, experience, and responsibilities mentioned in the job description but not present in the resume. 

3. Based on these identified skills, experience, and responsibilities, prepare concise, actionable points that can be seamlessly added to the resume.

4. Ensure all suggestions are tailored to reflect the real work experience and achievements in resume_text. Avoid generic or AI-generated language by closely aligning recommendations with actual experience described in the resume.

5. For each recommendation, specify exactly where the update should be made in resume_text, whether in the skills section, specific bullet points under work experience, or any other relevant section.

6. From the RAG data provided, provide a header **Best suggestions from RAG data**, and format the response such that all `text` values for the same `category` and `title` are grouped together. Format the response like this:

**category**
   - **title**
     - **text 1**
     - **text 2**

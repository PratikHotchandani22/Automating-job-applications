# ✅ Clerk Integration Complete!

All required Clerk components have been added according to the official documentation.

## 📁 Changes Made

### 1. Created `proxy.ts` (Required Middleware)
- ✅ Added `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- ✅ Configured matcher to skip Next.js internals and static files
- ✅ Always runs for API routes

### 2. Updated `components/AppShell.tsx`
- ✅ Added Clerk UI components:
  - `<SignInButton>` - Shows sign-in button for unauthenticated users
  - `<SignUpButton>` - Shows sign-up button for unauthenticated users
  - `<UserButton>` - Shows user profile menu for authenticated users
  - `<SignedIn>` - Wraps content visible only to authenticated users
  - `<SignedOut>` - Wraps content visible only to unauthenticated users
- ✅ Navigation tabs now only show when signed in
- ✅ "Start New Run" button only shows when signed in
- ✅ Refresh button only shows when signed in

## 🎯 What This Means

### For Unauthenticated Users:
- See "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons in the header
- Navigation tabs are hidden
- Cannot access dashboard features

### For Authenticated Users:
- See their profile button (`<UserButton>`) in the header
- See "Refresh" and "Start New Run" buttons
- See navigation tabs (Overview, Runs, Settings)
- Full access to dashboard features

## 🔄 User Flow

1. **User visits site** → Sees sign-in/sign-up buttons
2. **User clicks "Sign Up"** → Clerk modal opens
3. **User creates account** → Clerk handles authentication
4. **User is signed in** → `UserOnboarding` component creates user in Convex
5. **User sees dashboard** → Full access to all features

## ✅ Compliance Checklist

- ✅ `proxy.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` created
- ✅ `<ClerkProvider>` wrapping app in `app/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Using `@clerk/nextjs` package (not deprecated versions)
- ✅ Using App Router (not Pages Router)
- ✅ Clerk UI components in header
- ✅ `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>` for conditional rendering
- ✅ No references to deprecated `authMiddleware()` or `_app.tsx`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the app:**
   - You'll see sign-in/sign-up buttons
   - Click "Sign Up" to create an account
   - Clerk will automatically generate keys on first run (no manual setup needed!)

3. **Test the flow:**
   - Sign up → Should see user button appear
   - Navigation should appear
   - User should be created in Convex automatically

## 📝 Notes

- Clerk will automatically generate keys when you first run the app
- No need to manually add Clerk keys to `.env.local` initially
- The `proxy.ts` middleware handles authentication on all routes
- All protected routes are now automatically secured by Clerk

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your Clerk integration is now complete and follows all official documentation requirements!

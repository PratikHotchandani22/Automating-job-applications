Now i want you to update the points on the latex based on the new job resume, so i will share you a text description of how i want my new resume to be for a particular job and then you have to refactor the latex code without changing the format and the structure. In project section, make sure to include the necessary keywords on the right side of the title and also include the web-app link where ever present. In Awards section, make sure to keep the dates in right corner of the document using \hfill and also bold it. In project section, only keep the projects mentioned in the updated message with the updated text, remove all the other projects that are not mentioned. All you have to do is update the data in each section and bold the keywords(using \texbf{}) wherever it is in bold, except for the skills section, dont bold the keywords there.

I will share the updated text in next message
